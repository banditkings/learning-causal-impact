# pymc_statespace

Set of notebooks with gentle introductions to state space models with `statsmodels` (and `pymc_experimental`), bayesian inference with `numpyro`, and an evaluation of various time series utilities (i.e. `orbit`).

My aim is to have a simple onramp into Bayesian Structural Time Series by understanding components like:
* Concepts
  * Bayesian Inference
  * Bayesian Workflow
  * Hierarchical Models
  * State Space Models
  * Causal Inference
* Computation
  * `jax`
  * Modeling and Inference in `numpyro` and `pymc`
  * `arviz`
  * Time Series utilities - `causalimpact`, `orbit`, `nixtla`
