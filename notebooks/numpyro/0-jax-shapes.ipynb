    "# Shape Semantics in JAX and NumPyro\n",
    "\n",
    "Asked claude to help me better understand how JAX and numpyro handle the problems described in [Reasoning about Shapes and Probability Distributions](https://ericmjl.github.io/blog/2019/5/29/reasoning-about-shapes-and-probability-distributions/) where tensors by themselves can be overloaded. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Three Types of Shapes\n",
    "1. **Event Shape**\n",
    "   - Shape of a single draw from the distribution\n",
    "   - Example: `()` for univariate normal, `(3,)` for 3D multivariate normal\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Batch Shape**\n",
    "   - Shape of independent distributions\n",
    "   - Determined by broadcasting of distribution parameters\n",
    "   - Example: `(3,)` for batch of 3 independent normals\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Sample Shape**\n",
    "   - Shape of multiple samples drawn from distribution(s)\n",
    "   - Specified at sampling time\n",
    "   - Example: `(1000,)` for 1000 samples\n",
    "\n",
    "## JAX/NumPyro Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Distribution Properties\n",
    "```python\n",
    "normal = dist.Normal(loc=0., scale=1.)\n",
    "normal.event_shape    # ()\n",
    "normal.batch_shape    # ()\n",
    "\n",
    "batch_normal = dist.Normal(loc=jnp.array([0., 1., 2.]), scale=1.)\n",
    "batch_normal.event_shape    # ()\n",
    "batch_normal.batch_shape    # (3,)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Explicit Shape Attributes**\n",
    "   - Every distribution has `event_shape` and `batch_shape`\n",
    "   - Shapes are known at creation time\n",
    "   - Sample shapes specified during sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Shape Broadcasting**\n",
    "   - Follows JAX's broadcasting rules\n",
    "   - Parameter broadcasting determines batch shapes\n",
    "   - Automatic vectorization through JAX transforms\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Log Probability Handling**\n",
    "   - Respects batch vs event semantics\n",
    "   - Batch shapes → independent log probs\n",
    "   - Event shapes → joint log probs\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Shape Transformation**\n",
    "   - `Independent` distribution wrapper\n",
    "   - Converts batch dims to event dims\n",
    "   - Useful for grouping independent components\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Distribution Creation\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Single distribution\n",
    "normal = dist.Normal(0., 1.)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Batch of distributions\n",
    "batch_normal = dist.Normal(jnp.array([0., 1.]), 1.)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Multivariate distribution\n",
    "mvn = dist.MultivariateNormal(\n",
    "    loc=jnp.zeros(3),\n",
    "    covariance_matrix=jnp.eye(3)\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sampling\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Single sample\n",
    "x = normal.sample(key)                  # shape: ()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Multiple samples\n",
    "x = normal.sample(key, sample_shape=(5,))  # shape: (5,)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Batch sampling\n",
    "x = batch_normal.sample(key)            # shape: (2,)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Shape Transformation\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Convert batch to event\n",
    "independent = dist.Independent(batch_normal, 1)\n",
    "independent.event_shape     # (2,)\n",
    "independent.batch_shape     # ()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Shape Checking**\n",
    "   - Verify shapes early in development\n",
    "   - Use `assert` statements for shape validation\n",
    "   - Print shapes when debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Broadcasting**\n",
    "   - Be explicit about intended shapes\n",
    "   - Use `jnp.expand_dims` when needed\n",
    "   - Remember broadcasting happens right-to-left\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Performance**\n",
    "   - Use vectorized operations when possible\n",
    "   - Leverage JAX's automatic vectorization\n",
    "   - Consider batch shapes for parallel computation\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Common Gotchas**\n",
    "   - Mixing batch and event dimensions\n",
    "   - Incorrect broadcasting assumptions\n",
    "   - Forgetting to specify sample shapes"

    "# batch_shape: ()\n",
    "# event_shape: (2, 3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Effect Handlers\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. `plate`\n",
    "Manages batch dimensions for vectorized sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "        # x.shape is (10,)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. `vmap`\n",
    "JAX's vectorization transformer.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "## Shape Transformation Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Right-to-Left Processing**\n",
    "   - Shape transformations process dimensions from right to left\n",
    "   - Important for `to_event()` and `Independent`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Broadcasting Rules**\n",
    "   - Follow standard NumPy broadcasting rules\n",
    "   - Smaller shapes broadcast to larger shapes\n",
    "   - Single dimensions broadcast to any size\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Effect Handler Interactions**\n",
    "   - `plate` contexts create batch dimensions\n",
    "   - `to_event()` can convert plate dimensions to event dimensions\n",
    "   - Multiple plates stack from outside to inside\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Explicit Shape Transformations**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Prefer explicit transformations\n",
    "normal = dist.Normal(0., 1.).expand([2, 3]).to_event(2)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Over implicit reshaping\n",
    "normal = dist.Normal(jnp.zeros((2, 3)), 1.).to_event(2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Shape Validation**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def validate_shapes(dist):\n",
    "    assert len(dist.batch_shape) == 2, \"Expected 2 batch dimensions\"\n",
    "    assert len(dist.event_shape) == 1, \"Expected 1 event dimension\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Document Shape Transformations**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def model():\n",
    "    # Shape: batch=(10,), event=()\n",
    "    x = numpyro.sample('x', dist.Normal(0., 1.).expand([10]))\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Transform to: batch=(), event=(10,)\n",
    "    x_transformed = x.to_event(1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Pitfalls\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Unintended Broadcasting**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# This might not do what you expect\n",
    "dist.Normal(jnp.zeros(3), jnp.ones(2))  # Broadcasting creates 3x2 batch\n",
    "\n",
    "# Be explicit about intended shapes\n",
    "dist.Normal(jnp.zeros((3, 1)), jnp.ones((1, 2)))  # Clear 3x2 batch\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Order of Operations**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# These are different:\n",
    "dist.Normal(0., 1.).expand([2, 3]).to_event(2)\n",
    "dist.Normal(0., 1.).to_event(1).expand([2, 3])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Missing Shape Transformations**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# This might fail:\n",
    "log_prob = dist.Normal(0., 1.).log_prob(jnp.zeros(3))\n",
