# Learning Causal Impact

Set of notebooks with various introductions and examples to several topics relating to forecasting and causal inference for the applied practitioner, including state space models with `statsmodels` (and `pymc_experimental`), bayesian inference with `numpyro`, and an evaluation of various time series utilities (i.e. `orbit`). Also compares some libraries around causal inference (i.e. `CausalPy`, `tfcausalimpact`)

My aim is to have a simple onramp onto Bayesian Structural Time Series by understanding components like:

* Concepts
  * Bayesian Inference
  * Bayesian Workflow
  * Hierarchical Models
  * State Space Models
  * Causal Inference
* Computation
  * `jax`
  * Modeling and Inference in `numpyro` and `pymc`
  * `arviz`
  * Time Series utilities - `causalimpact`, `orbit`, `nixtla`
  * Wrangling multidimensional data with `xarray`
